My recent projects are (in order):
* Epet: Manage a petshop ecommerce using Laravel (backend) and Solidjs (frontend). In this project, my tasks were:
  1. Authenticate user using token-based authentication.
  2. Create a API.
  3. Manage stock of products based on shopping carts.
  4. Create and optimize cliente.
  5. Use ImageCDN on client.
* Event management: Manage school events using Android + Java. In this project, I did validation logic and screens (including add QR Code Reader).
* Metaverse: Transform the classrooms from reality to virtual rooms using Unity + spatial.io. In this project, I did the structure using SketchUp, optimize the assets using Blender and add assets and set collisions to them using Unity.
* Psychological Medical Evaluation: This project is composed by two subprojects:
  1. Business analysis: Analyze and create a document that solves the problem of data secrecy and lack of process automation when filling the evaluations.
  2. Web Development: Create an API application as MVP to simulate how the problem can be solved.
* Task To DO: Create a task to do list using Java and [gson](https://github.com/google/gson) simulating a NoSQL database (e.g. primary key and auto increment is implemented in application).
* Payment integration with Netflix: Create a document to analyze and discuss how Netflix could implement [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com) and [PIX](https://www.bcb.gov.br/estabilidadefinanceira/pix) at Brazil (Netflix doesn't support these payment options). In this project, I learned and used Persona, Empathy Map, Blueprint, Insight Cards and low, medium and high fidelity of Prototypes based on classes of Design Thinking.

My hobbies are:
* Chess: I always like to play chess, because my logic improves too much, especially if I'm learning new contents, for example, maths. And obviuous, it's funny!
* Music on acoustic guitar: a song is a nice breeze in a hot day.
